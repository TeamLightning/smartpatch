## Installation

As always, we wanted to make the installation very straight forward. Let composer do the hard stuffs and we will sit back and enjoy a cup of tea/coffee.

***Requirements***
* PHP7 >=
* php-mysql
* php-mbstring
* php-gd
* php-curl
* php-cli
* php-dom
* composer 1.4 >=

#### Let's start off with composer

Spice up your terminal and install this project in a fresh directory with this awesome command

```bash
composer create-project smarthacks/smartpatch
```

#### Create database and fly away,

I really hate to leave the installation of database in your hands. Let the script do it for you. Just install the script go the localhost and just add up the database credentials. It will take care of you more than you take care of yourself.
